1. When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to share your work with others.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

In the event that there are conflicts that need to be addressed.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of the other?

You can use fork to transfer another persons GH repository to your own GH account. A clone only applies to your local repositories. On branches, you can add features, fix bugs, and collaborate with other people.

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

In the future, when more changes have been added, you can go back to it and fix the bugs if need be.

5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

It would be easier to send files, but harder to keep track of the changes.
